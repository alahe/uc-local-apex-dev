## Create User and Workspace

Create a new database schema and APEX workspace in one command:

```bash
local-26ai.sh create-user movies
```

This will:

- Create a new schema with the given name
- Store the schema password in the `.env` file
- Save the connection in SQLcl's connection store
- Add all necessary development grants
- Give access to datapump directories
- Create an APEX workspace with convenient settings
- Optimize workspace settings like session length, max emails and REST messages and password lifetime

:::tip[Access Credentials]
You can access the workspace with:
- **Username**: `ADMIN` or the schema name (e.g., `MOVIES`)
- **Password**: `Welcome_1`
- **URL**: http://localhost:8181/ords/apex
:::

### Create Schema Only

If you only need a database schema without an APEX workspace:

```bash
local-26ai.sh create-user myschema --skip-workspace
```

### Clear a Schema

Useful for testing installation scripts multiple times:

```bash
local-26ai.sh clear-schema movies
# Asks for confirmation before proceeding
```

To skip the confirmation prompt (useful for automation), use the `-y` flag:

```bash
local-26ai.sh clear-schema movies -y
```

:::caution[Data Loss Warning]
This drops ALL objects in the schema. Never run this accidentally on important
schemas! Or better: run backups regularly.
:::

### Drop a Schema

Completely remove a schema and all its objects:

```bash
local-26ai.sh drop-user movies
```

## Database Access

### SQLcl and SQL Developer Access

All created users are automatically stored in SQLcl's connection store:

```bash
# Connect using the stored connection
sql -name local-26ai-movies

# Connect to sys user
sql -name local-26ai-sys
```

You will also find the connections in the VS Code SQL Developer extension. You might need to refresh the connections list after creating a new user.

### Other Development Tools

Use these connection details for other development tools:

- **Host**: 26ai
- **Port**: 1521
- **Service**: FREEPDB1
- **Username**: Your schema name
