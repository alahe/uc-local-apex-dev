## Create User and Workspace

Create a new database schema and APEX workspace in one command:

```bash
local-26ai.sh create-user movies
```

This will:

- Create a new schema with the given name
- Store the schema password in the `.env` file
- Save the connection in SQLcl's connection store
- Add all necessary development grants
- Give access to datapump directories
- Create an APEX workspace with convenient settings
- Optimize workspace settings like session length, max emails and REST messages and password lifetime

:::tip[Access Credentials]

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| URL | http://localhost:8181/ords/apex |
| Username | `ADMIN` or the schema name (e.g., `MOVIES`) |
| Password | `Welcome_1` |

:::

### Create Schema Only

If you only need a database schema without an APEX workspace:

```bash
local-26ai.sh create-user myschema --skip-workspace
```

### Create a Compressed Schema

Add `--compress` to enable [Advanced Compression](https://www.oracle.com/database/advanced-compression/) (included in Oracle Database Free) on the new schema's tablespace from the start. Every table and index created afterwards is stored compressed automatically — advanced row compression for tables, advanced index compression for B-tree indexes — keeping the schema's disk footprint smaller as it grows.

```bash
local-26ai.sh create-user movies --compress
# Combine with other flags as needed:
local-26ai.sh create-user myschema --skip-workspace --compress
```

<Aside type="tip" title="Already have data?">
  `--compress` only sets the defaults for *new* segments, so it's meant for a fresh schema. To compress a schema that already contains data, use [`compress-space`](/products/uc-local-apex-dev/docs/getting-started/common-tasks/#compress-a-schemas-tablespace) instead.
</Aside>

### Clear a Schema

Useful for testing installation scripts multiple times:

```bash
local-26ai.sh clear-schema movies
# Asks for confirmation before proceeding
```

To skip the confirmation prompt (useful for automation), use the `-y` flag:

```bash
local-26ai.sh clear-schema movies -y
```

:::caution[Data Loss Warning]
This drops ALL objects in the schema. Never run this accidentally on important
schemas! Or better: run backups regularly.
:::

### Drop a Schema

Completely remove a schema and all its objects. This also drops the schema's dedicated tablespace and its datafile, so the disk space is reclaimed instead of being left behind as an orphan:

```bash
local-26ai.sh drop-user movies
# Asks for confirmation before proceeding
```

To skip the confirmation prompt (useful for automation), use the `-y` flag:

```bash
local-26ai.sh drop-user movies -y
```

<Aside type="caution" title="Data Loss Warning">
  This permanently removes the schema, all its objects, and its datafile. Make sure you have backups of anything you need.
</Aside>

## Database Access

### SQLcl and SQL Developer Access

All created users are automatically stored in SQLcl's connection store:

```bash
# Connect using the stored connection
sql -name local-26ai-movies

# Connect to sys user
sql -name local-26ai-sys
```

You will also find the connections in the VS Code SQL Developer extension. You might need to refresh the connections list after creating a new user.

### Other Development Tools

Use these connection details for SQL Developer, DBeaver, or other tools:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Host | `localhost` |
| Port | `1521` |
| Service | `FREEPDB1` |
| Username | Your schema name (e.g., `MOVIES`) |
| Password | Value of `<NAME>_USER_PASSWORD` from `.env` |
