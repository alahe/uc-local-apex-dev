Get your Oracle 26ai database with APEX and ORDS running locally in just a few minutes. This guide will walk you through the complete setup process.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

### Required Software

- **Docker or Podman** — both are natively supported. The scripts auto-detect which engine is installed (preferring `docker` if both are present).
- **Compose** — either `docker compose` (v2 plugin, or the legacy `docker-compose` v1) or the native `podman compose` subcommand.
- **SQLcl** with "sql" command in PATH
- **Bash-compatible shell**

:::caution[Resource Requirements]
Make sure your virtual machine has enough resources allocated. **The default Podman VM will cause issues with Oracle**.

Recommended minimum:

- **4GB RAM**
- **3 CPUs**
- **20GB disk space**

### Platform-Specific Notes

#### macOS Users

If you're using macOS, [read the Podman setup guide](/products/uc-local-apex-dev/docs/other/podman-on-mac) for additional configuration steps.

#### Windows Users

We recommend using WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux) for the best experience. Follow these guides:

- [Install Ubuntu on WSL2](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/wsl/latest/howto/install-ubuntu-wsl2/).
- [Install docker in Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)
- [Install SQLcl in Linux](https://pacesettergraam.wordpress.com/2025/02/21/installing-sqlcl-in-ubuntu-linux-on-oci/)

## Quick Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/United-Codes/uc-local-apex-dev.git
cd uc-local-apex-dev
```

### 2. Make Scripts Executable

```bash
chmod +x ./install.sh ./local-26ai.sh ./setup.sh ./scripts/*.sh
```

### 3. Run the Installer

```bash
./install.sh
```

`install.sh` is a one-shot installer that does the full bootstrap end-to-end:

1. Detects the container engine (`docker` or `podman`) and the compose command. You can force one with `CONTAINER_CLI=podman ./install.sh`.
2. Checks that the compose command, `sql` (SQLcl), `unzip` and `curl`/`wget` are on your `PATH`.
3. Runs `./setup.sh` to generate `.env` with a random Oracle SYS password (skipped if `.env` already exists and contains all required keys).
4. Pulls the DB + ORDS container images.
5. Starts the stack with compose.
6. Waits for the database to be ready (up to 25 min) and for ORDS to finish its first-boot install (up to 15 min).
7. Sets the ORDS PL/SQL gateway mode to `proxied` (the recommended setting for APEX).
8. Runs `./scripts/after-first-db-start.sh` non-interactively — installs APEX, applies dev-friendly defaults (disables archive logs, relaxes APEX password rules), and sets the APEX `INTERNAL`/`ADMIN` password to the same `ORACLE_PASSWORD` value from `.env`.
9. Applies any APEX Patch Set Bundles found in the `apex-patches/` directory (see [Upgrade APEX](/products/uc-local-apex-dev/docs/migrations/upgrade-apex/#apply-apex-patch-set-bundles)).
10. Runs [post-install configuration](/products/uc-local-apex-dev/docs/getting-started/post-install/) if `post-install.conf` exists — creates workspaces, users, and ORDS connection pools.
11. Restarts the ORDS container so it picks up the new APEX module + config change, and waits for it to come back.

The whole flow takes roughly 15–20 minutes on a typical machine, mostly waiting on the Oracle DB to come up. When it finishes you'll see a `=== Done ===` banner with the next steps.

:::tip[Re-running install.sh]
`install.sh` is safe to re-run. If `.env` already exists and is complete, it's reused (no password rotation) and the readiness loops return immediately when the stack is already up.
:::

### 4. Log into APEX

Visit http://localhost:8181/ords/apex to log in. `install.sh` already set `ords --config /etc/ords/config config --db-pool default set plsql.gateway.mode proxied` and restarted ORDS so APEX is ready.

If you get an "Account Is Locked" message:

```sh
./scripts/unexpire-accounts.sh
```

If you don't want APEX to force you to change passwords:

```sh
./scripts/disable-password-expiration.sh
```

Optionally [set up local SSL/HTTPS](/products/uc-local-apex-dev/docs/getting-started/common-tasks/#ssl-configuration) for ORDS, or save disk space by removing the `apex` install folder:

```bash
rm -rf ./apex
```

### 5. PATH Configuration

For easier script access, add the repository to your PATH:

```bash
# Add to ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc
export PATH="/Users/username/path/to/uc-local-apex-dev:$PATH"
```

Then use scripts from anywhere:

```bash
local-26ai.sh create-user newproject
local-26ai.sh backup-all
local-26ai.sh stop
```

:::tip[Script Help]
Run `local-26ai.sh --help` to see all available commands and options.
:::

## Next Steps

Now that your environment is running:

1. **Create your first workspace**: `local-26ai.sh create-user myproject`
2. **Explore the available scripts**: `local-26ai.sh --help`
3. **Start developing your APEX applications**

## Access Your Environment

Once setup is complete, you can access:

- **APEX**: http://localhost:8181/ords/apex
- **ORDS Landing**: http://localhost:8181/ords/\_/landing
- **Database**: ai:1521 (Service: FREEPDB1)

### Default APEX Credentials

- **INTERNAL workspace**: `ADMIN` / value of `ORACLE_PASSWORD` in `.env`
- **Your own workspaces**: schema/workspace name from `./scripts/create-user.sh <NAME>` / matching `<NAME>_USER_PASSWORD` in `.env`
