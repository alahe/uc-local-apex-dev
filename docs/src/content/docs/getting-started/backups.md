### Backup All Users

Create datapump dumps of all users, including APEX workspaces and applications:

```bash
local-26ai.sh backup-all
```

Files are written to the `./backups/export` directory.

### Backup Specific Schema

Backup a single schema with its workspace and applications:

```bash
local-26ai.sh backup-schema movies
```

### Import Backup

Restore a previously created backup:

```bash
local-26ai.sh import-backup movies
```

:::note[Future Enhancements]
Currently this creates the user if it doesn't exist and imports the datapump
dump. I plan to enhance this to also import APEX workspaces and applications.
